\section{Overview}
\label{chap:intro:overview}

Over the last decade, computing has undergone a monumental shift from
locally stored data on a single personal computer to cloud-based data
stored on a multitude of third party servers. This shift has generated
many benefits: sharing data with other users is trivial, multi-modal
communication between users is easy, and compute devices are largely
ephemeral, easily replaced or transitioned between without any
significant overhead or loss of user data. This transition, however,
has a significant side effect: user data is now largely stored in a
manner where it is easily accessible to third parties beyond the
user's immediate control. The shift from locally stored and controlled
data to third-party stored and controlled data has a number of
consequences, from increased risk of data compromise by hackers
targeting centralized third-party data stores, to reduced legal
protections from government introspection, to its use in ``big-data''
systems capable of ascertaining more private information than most
users likely intend to share.

The popularity of the cloud model leads one to believe that most users
are willing to trade the privacy and control afforded by traditional
local compute and storage for the convenience and features cloud-based
services provide. And yet, a 2014 Pew Research study found that over
90\% of American adults agree that they have lost control over the
data they store in the cloud, 80\% are concerned about how cloud
companies are using their data, and 70\% are concerned about the
manner is which the government might access their data in the
cloud~\cite{pew-privsec14}. Furthermore, the myriad of recently
publicized data leaks at large companies
(e.g.~\cite{apple-icloudleak}) as well as ongoing government
intrusions into third-party user data stores
(e.g.~\cite{greenwald-prism}) has propelled the debate over user
privacy in the age of the cloud to new levels.

The traditional viewpoint holds that users must choose between either
the conveniences the cloud provides or the privacy and security of
locally stored and processed data. I do not feel that this is
true. Instead, I believe that there are mechanisms that can allow
users to retain a high degree of control over how their data is
stored, accessed, and used while still allowing them to leverage a
variety of modern third-party services. The solution lies in
developing systems that allow users to place limits on the degree to
which they must trust any single third party while still allowing them
to leverage the desirable features such parties provide.

To achieve such a solution, I propose a new data storage model called
``Secret Storage as a Service'' (SSaaS). In an SSaaS ecosystem, a user
designates one or more trusted secret storage providers (SSPs), either
self hosted or third party, with storing and regulating access to
their private secrets (personal information, encryption keys, etc) on
their behalf. Such secrets can then be used to bootstrap the security
of other data stores via existing cryptographic and related
techniques. Existing technologies and services can than interface with
these SSPs via a standard interface to access user secrets or the data
they protect as allowed by a user-defined set of access control
rules. In effect, the SSPs are tasked with regulating access to user
data by more traditional feature-oriented third-party services
(e.g. Google or Facebook).

The SSaaS model provides a number of benefits over the existing
practice of utilizing feature-desirable third-party services, and in
doing so, granting them unfettered access to user data. Such benefits
include:

\begin{packed_desc}
\item[No Single Trusted Third Party] \hfill \\ In an SSaaS ecosystem,
  the secret storage provider is separate from the provider of the
  end-user cloud service (e.g. Dropbox, Gmail, etc). Furthermore, a
  user may shard their secrets across multiple SSPs, or even host
  their own SSP. This ensures that a user is not giving any single
  entity control over or unfettered access to their secrets (or by
  proxy, to the data such secrets might protect).
\item[Separation of Duties] \hfill \\ In an SSaaS ecosystem, a user
  selects a secret storage provider on the basis of their trust in
  that provider while selecting a feature service provider on the
  basis of the end-user services they provide. This allows a user to
  optimize each selection individually instead of having to chose a
  single provider on the basis of both trust and feature set, likely
  having to sacrifice one in favor of the other.
\item[Support for Existing Use Cases] \hfill \\ The SSaaS ecosystem is
  capable of supporting many modern use cases such as sharing data
  with other users, syncing it across a number of personal computing
  devices, or automating access to such data from a variety of
  services. Thus, SSaaS allows users to gain privacy and security
  benefits without having to forgo common and popular use cases.
\end{packed_desc}

\section{Motivating Examples}
\label{chap:intro:example}

As a motivating example, consider the Dropbox cloud file locker
service~\cite{dropbox}. Dropbox provides a service through which users
may upload arbitrary files in order to sync them between multiple
devices and to share them with other users. In order to support this
functionally, Dropbox stores a copy of each user's uploaded files on
the Dropbox servers. This ensures that Dropbox can provide copies of
the files to new user devices or to other users when asked to sync or
share a file on the user's behalf.

But how private are a user's files once uploaded to Dropbox? While
Dropbox does encrypt files while they are stored on the Dropbox
servers as well as while they are in transit between the Dropbox
servers and a client machine~\cite{dropbox-security}, Dropbox also
holds a copy of the associated encryption keys, enabling them to
decrypt a user's files whenever they desire. This also means that an
adversary may be able to decrypt user files if they are able to
compromise both Dropbox's data storage servers as well as their key
storage servers. The US government could also decrypt user files
stored via Dropbox should a court compel Dropbox to provide both the
files and the associated encryption keys. Furthermore, a rogue actor
within Dropbox could leverage their access to all of Dropbox's
infrastructure to access and decrypt user files. Clearly Dropbox's
practice of storing both a user's encrypted files as well as a copy of
the associated encryption keys provides only marginally more security
and privacy of the user data then not using encryption at all. And the
added security it does provide is wholly dependent on placing a high
degree of trust in Dropbox to faithfully protect and manage the
relevant encryption keys.

An alternative approach would be for Dropbox to put the user in charge
of encrypting/decrypting files and storing all necessary encryption
keys, ensuring the Dropbox itself never has direct access to
unencrypted user files. While this form of client-side encryption
could potentially increase the privacy and security of user data in
the event that Dropbox's data stores are compromised, searched,
monitored, or simply misused, is also has some significant downsides:

\begin{packed_enum}
\item It breaks Dropbox's sharing use case. While user's can still
  share encrypted versions of their files, they would then have to
  exchange the associated encryption key out of band in order to
  effectively decrypt, read, or update any shared file. This
  essentially nullifies Dropbox's appeal as a simple method for
  sharing files with other users.
\item It complicates Dropbox's syncing use case. Whereas before a
  Dropbox user can bootstrap a new Dropbox client device simply by
  signing into their Dropbox account, users must now both sign into
  their Dropbox account and provide a copy of their encryption
  key/keys in order for the Dropbox client to successfully perform the
  required client-side encryption operations. This adds an additional
  step to the Dropbox setup process, potentially driving away novice
  and lay users.
\item If the user ever losses their encryption keys, they will
  effectively lose access to all of their Dropbox-stored
  files. Similarly, if a user mishandles their keys in a manner that
  allows others to access them, they have effectively negated the
  additional privacy or security client-side encryption provides. A
  user would have to be diligent about ensuring they maintain access
  to their keys via backups, etc, while also ensuring their keys do
  not fall into the wrong hands. Again, such manual management
  requirements pose a non-trivial burden for many users.
\end{packed_enum}

Thus, we're left in a situation where the user must chose between the
convenience of using Dropbox as it exists today while also sacrificing
a significant degree of privacy over the files they upload to Dropbox,
or the burden of employing traditional client-side encryption models
where the trust they must place in Dropbox is reduced, but where many
core Dropbox features (e.g. simple file sharing) are no longer
feasible to use. Neither of these are ideal solutions. We would like a
solution that allows the user to leverage the existing convenience and
benefits of using Dropbox while also reducing the trust they must
place in the Dropbox corporation.

These challenges are not unique to Dropbox. There are many modern
technologies and services that force the user to chose between
convenience and feature set vs privacy and control. For example:

\begin{packed_desc}
\item[Mobile Computing Devices] \hfill \\
  Phones, tablets, and laptops have become ubiquitous modes of modern
  computing, storing large fractions of our personal data and carrying
  out computations on our behave. But these devices, while convenient,
  are also prone to loss, theft, and remote exploitation, exposing the
  data they store and computations they undertake to a range of
  external actors.
\item[Cloud Computing Infrastructure] \hfill \\
  Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) systems such as Amazon's
  EC2~\cite{amazon-ec2} or Google's Compute
  Engine~\cite{google-compute} are popular mechanisms for hosting
  modern compute services. Unfortunately these services require the
  user to fully trust the backing infrastructure provider and make it
  difficult to deploy security-enhancing systems like full disk
  encryption due to the user's lack of physical server access.
\item[Datacenter Infrastructure] \hfill \\
  Modern data centers are highly automated. It is thus not acceptable to
  assume a trusted user will be available to enter boot-time passwords in
  order to bootstrap full disk-encryption systems. Thus, using
  disk encryption systems on highly automated servers in difficult or
  impossible to do securely.
\end{packed_desc}

All of these examples share a common deficiency: they force the user
into a position of choosing between desirable feature sets or
desirable security and privacy qualities. It is this deficiency that I
seek to quantify and work to resolve via the work presented in this
proposal.

\section{Goals}
\label{chap:intro:goals}

At the core, the goals of my proposed work are threefold:

\begin{packed_item}
\item Quantify and analyze the trust and threat models inherent in
  modern mobile, cloud, and datacenter computing solutions.
\item Provide secret-storage primitives that allow users to minimize,
  manage, and monitor the degree to which they must trust third party
  devices and services with such data.
\item Use such secret-storage primitives to create security and
  privacy enhancing systems well adopted for a range of modern,
  common, and desirable use cases.
