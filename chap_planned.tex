\chapter{Proposed Work}
\label{chap:planned}

Thus far, I've laid out an overview of the SSaaS model as a means for
limiting third party trust and increasing the security and privacy of
today's computing users across a range of modern use cases. In this
chapter, I propose the remaining work that will be completed for
inclusion in my dissertation. This work all builds on or expands the
work discussed thus far.

\section{Existing Services Surveys}

The first body of work I propose involves taking the Trust framework
presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:trust} and applying it to a variety of
existing services of the purpose of analyzing the degree of third
party trust usage of each service entails. Such surveys will be
useful in further demonstrating the current state of the art and
security challenges posed by existing systems. I propose analyzing the
trust models of several classes of existing cloud services, each of
which is discussed briefly in the following subsection.

Such survey will analyze the publicly available information about
currently available services, including both provider-provided
documentation, independent analyses, and examples of known security
failures. In some cases it may also be necessary to experiment with the
services directly for the purpose of further exploring how they should
be categorized within my proposed trust analyses framework. These
analysis will provide the basis designing SSaaS-backed solutions that
exhibit more desirable trust profiles then existing systems.

\subsection{Consumer Web Services}

One proposed trust analysis survey will include an in-depth analysis of
several prototypical end-user facing cloud services. Paternal services
for analysis include:

\begin{packed_item}
\item Cloud storage services such as Dropbox~\cite{dropbox},
  SpiderOak~\cite{spideroak}, and BitTorrent
  Sync~\cite{bittorrent-sync}.
\item Social media, communication, and related services such as
  Facebook~\cite{facebook}, Gmail~\cite{google-gmail}, and
  Uber~\cite{uber}.
\item Password managers such as LastPass~\cite{lastpass} and
  OnePassword~\cite{onepassword}.
\item Financial services such as banks, aggregators like
  Mint~\cite{mint}, and payment services such as Google
  Wallet~\cite{google-wallet} and Apple Pay~\cite{apple-pay}.
\end{packed_item}

\subsection{Developer Web Services}

A second proposed trust analyses survey will focus on common
developer-facing third party services. Potential services for analysis
include:

\begin{packed_item}
\item IaaS providers such as Amazon EC2~\cite{amazon-ec2},
  RackSpace~\cite{rackspace-compute}, and Google Compute
  Engine~\cite{google-compute}.  Sync~\cite{bittorrent-sync}.
\item Traditional configuration management solutions such as
  Chef~\cite{chef} and Puppet~\cite{puppet}.
\item Cloud key management services such as OpenStack
  Barbican~\cite{openstack-barbican}, Amazon Cloud
  HSM~\cite{amazon-hsm}, and Gezzang zTrustee~\cite{gazzang}.
\end{packed_item}
