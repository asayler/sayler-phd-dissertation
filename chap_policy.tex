\chapter{Policy Implications}
\label{chap:policy}

The work presented in this document impinges a number of policy
questions in the security and privacy space. A number of these
implications have been alluded to in the previous chapters. This
chapter explores some of these policy questions in greater depth.

\section{Cryptography}
\label{chap:policy:crypto}

Many of the ideas proposed in this document rely on the use of a
variety of cryptographic primitives, including symmetric encryption,
message authentication codes (MAC), asymmetric encryption, asymmetric
authentication, and cryptographic signatures. Such cryptographic
primitives, however, have a checkered legal and policy history, at
least in the United States\footnote{the bulk of this chapter will
  focus on US policy and laws since that is the jurisdiction in which
  the author resides and is most intimately familiar. Similar ideas
  are applicable to other jurisdictions.}. This section provides an
overview of cryptography-related policy concerns.

\subsection{Limits on Use of Cryptography}
\label{chap:policy:crypto:limits}

From the export-control bans of the first crypto wars~\cite{kehl2015}
to the Apple v FBI crypto debate, whether or not strong cryptography
should be available to the general public is a hotly debated
topic. Should the government ever succeed in banning or strongly
curtailing the development, distribution, or use of strong
cryptography, it will become substantially more difficult (if not
impossible) to securely implement SSaaS-related ideas, and by proxy,
the privacy and security enhancements SSaaS systems might
provide. Indeed, any effort that curtails the use or access to strong
cryptography is likely to damage the security of a wide range of digital
systems.

\subsubsection{A brief history of Cryptography Regulation}

Strong cryptography is a relatively recent development in the timeline
of human history. Modern digital cryptography didn't really come about
until the end World War Two and the advent of information
theory~\cite{shannon1945}. Prior to that point in time, most
``cryptography'' systems were based on folk-theory, obscure language,
one-time pads, mechanical machines, or other items not soundly rooted
in mathematical theory. Even though the groundwork was laid by the end
of world war two, modern practical digital cryptography systems didn't
really become available until the publication of DES in the mid
1970~\cite{fips46} and the invention of asymmetric cryptography around
the same time~\cite{diffie1976}. The combination of a standardized
symmetric key algorithms coupled with the ability to negotiate and/or
exchange symmetric keys over insecure channels using asymmetric
techniques made digital cryptography a practical tool for securing
communications, the security of which rested on the provable
difficulty of solving certain classes of mathematical problems. From
the late 1970s through the 1980s, digital cryptography remained
largely a tool for governments, militaries, and financial
corporations, and as such was often classified as a ``munition'' and
placed under various export control laws regulating the manner in
which encryption technology could be distributed outside of the United
States. During this time, cryptographically secure systems were not
readily available for use by individuals not associated with the
aforementioned institutions.

The availability of strong cryptography to the general public begin to
change in the early 1990s with the release of
PGP~\cite{zimmermann-pgp10}. PGP quickly became the first widely
distributed encryption software designed for use by ordinary
individuals. It's Internet-based distribution also quickly drew the
attention of US authorities who viewed it as a violation of the export
control laws banning the export of cryptographic technology with key
length beyond 40-bits. In defiance of such acquisitions, PGP's author
published the entire source code of PGP as a book, the contents of
which could be scanned and compiled by anyone with a
copy~\cite{zimmermann-pgpsource}. This publication forced a discussion
of the First Amendment~\cite{us-constitution-amend1} issues associated
with the distribution of computer source code. Such discussions,
coupled with several court cases~\cite{ninthcir-bernstein,
  sixthcir-junger} in favor of the protection of computer source code
under the First Amendment, led to the US government rolling back
(although not completely eliminating) most of the export control rules
surrounding cryptography by the early 2000s~\cite{kehl2015}.

During this same time, the government tried to standardize a
backdoored encryption system known as the Clipper
Chip~\cite{whitehouse-clipper}. The chip was designed to be embedded
in systems where it would provide ``strong'' encryption via the
Slipjack algorithm while maintaining the government's ability to
decrypt such encryption via the use of escrowed master keys. The
Clipper Chip quickly feel into disfavor, however, when researchers
demonstrated simple methods for bypassing its escrow
mechanisms~\cite{blaze1994}. This was soon followed by discoveries of
weaknesses in the Slipjack algorithm~\cite{biham1998}. The Clipper
chip was never widely adopted at the government largely gave up on
pushing backdoored encryption systems by the start of the 2000s.

After the failure of both the governments export control based
regulations and their pushes for key escrow-based encryption standards
in the 1990s, efforts to control and regulate cryptography were
largely quote through the 2000s and early 2010s. But by the mid 2010s,
however, such efforts again begin to pick up. The Edward Snowden
revelations related to spying abuses by the US National Security
Agency (NSA) in the early 2010s led to a rise in privacy awareness
among the general populace~\cite{pew-privsec14}. This, in turn, led a
push to increase is the sue of strong cryptography across a wide range
of products, from websites~\cite{mozilla-deprecatehttp} to
email~\cite{gmail-blog-encryption} to
smartphones~\cite{ars-ios-encrypt, ars-android-encrypt}. The
associated increase is end-user use of cryptography has led to renewed
calls by law enforcement agencies (most notably the US FBI) to mandate
the use of breakable encryption in any scenario were the government
can get a warrant to access the associated
data~\cite{comey-testimony-encryption}. Such calls have culminated in
the ongoing court battle between Apple and FBI over whether or not the
FBI can use the All Writs Act~\cite{usc-allwrits} to compel Apple to
modify the iPhone operating system to expedite the rate at which the
FBI can guess the pass-code required to decrypt the
phone~\cite{ars-cookvfbi}. Congress has also responded to such calls
by suggesting legislation ranging from the formation of encryption
``study'' committees~\cite{hr4651} to outright bans on the use of
strong encryption~\cite{bennett-burrbill} to bans on such bans of
encryption~\cite{hr4528}. How these court cases and legislative
actions will play out remains to be seen.

\subsubsection{A Defense of Cryptography}

Government efforts to ban cryptography have been countered with a
variety of legal and policy arguments. These arguments won out during
the efforts to regulate and ban cryptography during the
1990s. Hopefully, they will win out again today.

From a policy perspective, there are a variety arguments against
efforts to ban or regulate various form of cryptography. They tend to
fall along a two standard lines:

\begin{packed_desc}
\item[More Harm Than Good] \hfill \\ As discussed in this document and
  elsewhere~\cite{abelson2015}, cryptography is a critical tool for
  protecting the security and privacy of modern computing
  systems. Thus, any effort aimed at weakening cryptography for the
  purpose of minimizing its effectiveness to ``bad'' actors is just as
  likelihood to minimizing its effectiveness to ``good'' actors that
  rely on cryptography to protect their system and data. Indeed,
  efforts to curtail the use of strong cryptography would severely
  damage the security of financial, communication, and data storage
  systems. Any backdoor available to the US government is an
  additional point of failure that an attacker may use to compromise
  and access a system. Furthermore, any policy of providing the US
  government with special access to cryptographically protected data
  will likely be mirrored by other countries -- many of which may have
  far weaker legal protections against the abuse of such
  powers. E.g. if the US government can demand special access, so can
  China or North Korea -- weakening the security of US citizens abroad
  or anyone wishing to secure their selves and systems from
  potentially repressive regimes. Bans of cryptography thus trade the
  security of a huge number of normal individuals for the insecurity
  of a small number of potentially bad actors -- and that's not a
  trade that's worth making.
\item[Ineffectiveness] \hfill \\ Beyond the fact that bans on
  cryptography are likely to cause more harm than good to society as a
  whole, such bans are widely believed to be largely ineffective. Even
  if the US manages to ban the use of cryptography, cryptographic
  concepts are no longer a niche subject. There are hundreds
  cryptographic products available worldwide, more of half of which
  are developed and distributed outside o after Untied
  States~\cite{schneier2016}. The Internet and modern commerce systems
  make such products widely available to almost anyone. Thus, even if
  the US manages to ban cryptography, those wishing to sue it will
  just obtain cryptography related products elsewhere. Modern
  cryptographic concepts are also widely understood and
  taught~\cite{schneier2010crypto}. There are thus a wide variety of
  individuals capable of creating cryptographic secure systems from
  scratch.\footnote{Although it is not advisable for most individuals
    to attempt to ``roll their own'' cryptography due to the
    likelihood of mistakes and lack of formal vetting and review.} It
  would not be difficult for organizations or individuals wishing to
  employ even banned cryptography concepts to find someone to build
  such systems for them.
\item[Better Options] \hfill \\ Law enforcement organizations (LEOs)
  often cute the ``going dark'' problem as the reason why
  cryptographic restrictions are necessary. ``Going dark'' refer to
  the idea that as the use of cryptography grows the ability to law
  enforcement to monitor criminal activity and prevent or prosecute
  crimes diminishes~\cite{anderson2013}. What this viewpoint fails to
  acknowledge is the fact that this is the golden age of surveillance
  - and law enforcement agencies have access to more data than they
  ever have had before~\cite{swire2011}. Thus, even with the
  widespread use of encryption, LEOs have more access to digital
  criminal data than at any point in human history. As such, there are
  number ways to combat crime without weakening encryption. Such
  mechanisms may require more time and effort than the kind automated
  digital surveillance subverted by the use of encryption, but such
  time and effort is a necessary price to pay to ensure the balance
  between privacy and security. Instead of weakening encryption, law
  enforcement can focused on targeted investigations of specific
  individuals, leveraging the large digital footprints even
  cryptography-employing users leave behind. And even when using
  cryptography, individuals are still prone to a wide range of
  targeted attacks, from efforts to compromise individual systems, and
  subvert any cryptography they may employ in the process to social
  engineering Attucks that are historically very effective against
  even cryptography employing adversaries. AT the end of the day,
  there are numerous tools available to law enforcement to pursue
  criminals. Weakening encryption need not be one of them.
\end{packed_desc}

Beyond policy arguments against regulating or banning cryptography, there
are also a number of legal arguments preventing such efforts. In
particular, any effort to ban cryptography would raise series
constitutional questions, including:

\begin{packed_desc}
\item[1\textsuperscript{st} Amendment] \hfill \\ As previously
  mentioned, bans on the publication of source code,
  cryptography-related or otherwise, raise numerous
  1\textsuperscript{st} Amendment questions. The free speech
  guarantees provided by the 1\textsuperscript{st} Amendment have
  generally been interpreted to apply to source
  code~\cite{ninthcir-bernstein, sixthcir-junger}.\footnote{Indeed,
    this ``code as speech'' interpretation is fairly critical to the
    use of US Copyright Law for the protection of code-related
    intellectual property.} As such, any ban on cryptography source
  code is likely an unconstitutional prior restraint on the author's
  freedom of speech. Traditionally, courts have taken a dim few of
  laws imposing such prior restraint~\cite{scotus-nearvminnesota},
  even in cases where national security my be
  impinged~\cite{scotus-nytvus}. Additionally, efforts to mandate the
  inclusion of a backdoor in certain software are likely
  unconstitutional compelled speech. Just as blocking the publication
  of source code interferes with the author's free speech rights,
  mandating the author publish or included certain components in their
  code is also a violation of their free speech
  rights~\cite{scotus-wooleyvmaynard}. While there have been
  exceptions such interpretations, it's unlikely that broadness of any
  general purpose cryptography limitations coupled with the likely
  ineffectiveness of such rules would meet the kind of ``narrowly
  tailored speech limits in effective support of a legitimate
  government interest'' requirements such a law would have to overcome
  to meet constitutional muster.
\item[2\textsuperscript{nd} Amendment] \hfill \\ 
\item[4\textsuperscript{th} Amendment] \hfill \\ 
\item[5\textsuperscript{th} Amendment] \hfill \\
