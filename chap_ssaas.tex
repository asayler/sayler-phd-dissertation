\chapter{Secret Storage as a Service}
\label{chap:ssaas}

As discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:challenges}, the reliance on third
parties inherent to many popular use cases today poses a number of
privacy and security related challenges. Fortunately, cryptographic
techniques including encryption and authentication provide the
necessary primitives for building a systems that increases the
security and privacy of users by reducing their exposure to third
party-related abuse. Such systems also provide additional security
outside of the traditional third-party risk model by ensure that
systems such as mobile devices that are prone to loss or theft remain
security even when outside the position of their
owners. Unfortunately, cryptography is not merely ``magic fairy dust''
that we can sprinkle on any security or privacy problem to make it
disappear~\cite{smith2003}. Effectively using cryptographic technique
to secure our data involves ensuring that cryptography-employing
security and privacy enhancing solution are designed securely and
usability.

The key to designing secure and usable cryptographic data security
solutions lies in providing secure and flexible secret storage systems
that can be leveraged to manage and access the associated
cryptographic keys protecting any such system. The failure of
traditional cryptographic systems to account for key management has
led many such systems to be unusable, insecure, and/or ill adapted to
modern user cases. I propose the creation of a standardized Secret
Storage as a Service system designed to provide users with the
necessary tools for managing secrets such as cryptographic keys in a
manner that allows for a range of multi-device and multi-user use
cases and that avoids placing high degrees of trust in signaler third
parties. I present the design and justification of such a system in
this chapter.
