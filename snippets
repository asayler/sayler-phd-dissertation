Today, users select third-part services on the basis of the features
they provide; the inherent trust in such third parties using such
services entails is a secondary concern, if a concern at all. Thus, we
are selecting third-party services for their feature set and merely
accepting whatever trust and security implications that entails. The
SSaaS architecture seeks to allow us to continue to select third-party
services on the basis of features while avoiding the accompanying
trust such actions traditionally entail.
